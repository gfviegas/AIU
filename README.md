Intro
====================================================================================

Assynch Image Uploader (AIU) is a plugin to make asynchronous images uploads with a preview of the image to be sent.

Hey, why should I use AIU?
====================================================================================
Mostly ajax-send-images plugins have scripts too heavy, or uses iFrames, which is not optimal. They are heavy and bugs your codes. IE 10- needs to use them, unfortunately.
So why would you make a heavy form if you have AIU in your hands? ;)
